Single-server-cliet-TCP-proxy
=============================

A TCP proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and another server, called the destination server. Clients establish connections to the TCP proxy server, which then establishes a connection to the destination server. The proxy server sends data received from the client to the destination server and forwards data received from the destination server to the client.
